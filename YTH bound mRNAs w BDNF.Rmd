```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(PCAtools)
library(gprofiler2)
library(pcaExplorer)
library(clusterProfiler)
library(RColorBrewer)

```


```{r read in file}
YTH_bound_mrna_file_path <- file.path(here::here("data","YTH bound mRNAs.csv"))

yth_bound_mrna <- read_csv(YTH_bound_mrna_file_path)
```

want to look at the genes downregulated with high fraction new mrna at 2hr to see if YTH is associated with the decay
